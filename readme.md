# Exercises for Programmers

This repositories contains solutions for [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) by [Brian Hogan](//github.com/napcs). The repo structure was highly influenced by [@TrevorBramble](https://github.com/TrevorBramble/exercises-for-programmers).

## Plan

My focus for implementing the solution to each excercise is on JavaScript. I will ignore exercise "challenges" on the first run through, then possibly revisit them subsequently.

## Organization

Each exercise will have its own self-contained directory within this repository including a `readme` to document the problem and related details.
